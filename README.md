  Netflix Data Visualization Dashboard
Project Overview
This project features an "interactive Tableau dashboard" created to analyze and visualize Netflix subscription data. The dashboard provides key insights into user demographics, 
revenue trends, and subscription behavior to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions. 

  Key Features:-
The dashboard includes the following visualizations:
1. Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Highlights revenue generated per user.
2. Subscription Type Distribution: Displays the proportion of different subscription plans (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium).
3. Number of Users by Device: Shows the distribution of users by device type (e.g., Mobile, Desktop, TV).
4. Gender Breakdown: Analyzes the gender distribution of Netflix users.
5. Total Revenue by Subscription Type: Summarizes revenue by subscription plans.
6. Monthly Revenue Trend: Provides a time-series analysis of revenue growth over months.
7. Count of Users by Country: Geographical distribution of Netflix users.
8. Age Group and Gender Distribution: Combines age group analysis with gender for detailed user demographics.
9. Monthly Revenue by Country: Displays revenue trends across different countries.
10. Interactivity filter added to "Monthly Revenuue By Country"
